    "description": "I'm Muskan Kushwah, a Full Stack Developer with 3+ years of professional experience, currently working at Chaperone. My expertise lies in building and scaling web applications using Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and AWS. I lead end-to-end product development â€” from feature discussions and architecture design to deployment and team management. Recently, Iâ€™ve expanded my journey into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, an area Iâ€™ve always been passionate about. Over the last month, Iâ€™ve been actively learning and building projects in Deep Learning, Transformers, and Hugging Face pipelines for tasks like NER and text classification. My goal is to bridge my strong full-stack background with advanced AI/ML capabilities to create impactful, intelligent systems.",
